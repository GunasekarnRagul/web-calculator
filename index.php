                values during calculations. These functions are usually represented by buttons such as "M+", "M-", "MR",
                and "MC" for memory addition, subtraction, recall, and clear, respectively.</li>
              <li>Clearing and Resetting: Web calculators often include a "Clear" or "AC" button to clear the
                calculator's display and start a new calculation. Some calculators may also provide a "Reset" button to
                clear any stored values or memory.</li>
              <li>Error Handling: If users input invalid or unsupported expressions, the web calculator may display
                error messages or provide error handling mechanisms to guide users in correcting their input.</li>
              <li>Responsiveness: Web-based scientific calculators are designed to be responsive, adapting to different
                screen sizes and devices. They can be accessed and used on desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and
                mobile phones through a web browser.</li>
